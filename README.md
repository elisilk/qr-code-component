## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [BEM](https://getbem.com/) - component naming convention

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<section class="card">
  <img class="card__img" src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code" />
  <h1 class="card__title">
    Improve your front-end skills by building projects
  </h1>
  <p class="card__description">
    Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the
    next level
  </p>
</section>
```

### Continued development

Definitely want to continue to think about the use of heading levels.

### Useful resources

- [What heading level to use?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) - I'm not actually sure if the title of the card should be an h1 element or not. It is the only h1 on the page, but maybe the idea is that it would be used as a component within a larger page? And so what heading level is the right level?

## Acknowledgments

I definitely want to acknowledge [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/). Kevin's email newsletter inspired me to give Frontend Mentor a try, and his YouTube video of another Frontend Mentor challenge was the model I used to develop my own solution to this challenge.
